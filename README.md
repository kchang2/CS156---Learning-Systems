# Learning from Data, the ML way!

## What is this?
My continuation of interest in Machine Learning (ML). The goal of taking this class was to bolster what I had learned this summer from my research, and gain a stronger theoretical insight at the fundamentals in ML techniques. Writing 90% of the ML algorithms from scratch in Python, I experienced a growth both breadth and depth at the tools I could use to solve problems. Although the series of scenarios are rather shallow in difficulty, they open up a skillset that can be used at will for more complex problems.

### Modules you will need
Because I run this mainly on Python (2.7.11 or 3, as I have mixed around for some of the assignments), you will need the following modules:
+ NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

<i> Since I have not looked back at my solutions for some time, these are just some of the modules I recall as most significant. </i>


## Ownership of Files
Please note the lecture notes and assignments are the property of [Professor Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa](http://ee.caltech.edu/people/2893/profile), a well known Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at The California Institute of Technology (Caltech). I will remove these files at anytime -- he has the right to those files. 

## To Caltech students
You may only look at the appropriate solutions once you have completed the course / submitted the appropriate assignments.

Thank you.
